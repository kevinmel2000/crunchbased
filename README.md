CrunchBase for Android
======================

CrunchBase application for Android OS.

Requirements to build and run:
* Android 4.0.3 (API level 15) or above
* Support libraries
* Add Android Annotations generated sources to the project source sets (in IDE such as Android Studio)

All library dependencies are pulled in via the build system.

Future plans include improving backward compatibility to allow the application to run on older versions of Android.
